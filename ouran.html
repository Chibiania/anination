<p class="center">Haruhi Fujioka has won a scholarship to attend the prestigious Ouran Academy. Haruhi doesn't really care what others think of her physical appearance or that she is not rich like the other students. One day, she stumbles into the elite Host Club and accidentally knocks over a very expensive vase. Unable to pay her debt, she has to work it off by becoming a male host to entertain the ladies of the school.  </p>

<p>Domon Kashuu has been selected to represent his nation, Neo-Japan, in a world where much of humanity lives in space colonies. The dominance of the colonies is determined by a tournament held once every four years. Colony representatives must use giant robots called gundams to fight in the tournament. Domon's fight is for his country but more so for the quest to find his brother, who has been blamed for the deaths of their parents and the disappearance of a very dangerous weapon.</p>

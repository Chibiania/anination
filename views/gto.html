<p class="center">Onizuka is a former biker gang leader seeking retribution as a school teacher. His goal is to become the world's greatest teacher...so he can meet attractive high school girls. Although, his reasons are dubious, Onizuka is firm in his goal. However, his delinquent class and overly strict administers will stop at nothing to have him quit. Which is good for Onizuka since he has his biker gang experience to fall back on to foil their plans.</p>

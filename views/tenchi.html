<p><h3> Muyo</h3></p>
<p>Tenchi Masaki is a 17 year old living in rural Japan. He has no idea how his life is about to be changed. Enter Galaxy Police officers chasing a space pirate, just to crash land at his grandfather's temple. Tenchi will venture into unknown territory including women, aliens, and space!</p>

<p><h3> Tokyo</h3></p>
<p>Tenchi is back! Wanting to live a normal life, he moves to Tokyo. There, he meets Sakuya. They fall in love and everything is great until it turns out Sakuya was created by a dark force. With his love life on the line, pestering friends all over the place, and the earth needing defending, it seems like Tenchi's Tokyo life is anything but normal.</p>
